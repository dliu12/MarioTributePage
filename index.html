                <h2>Character About</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is cheerful, inspiring, and jumpy (Nintendo "Characters")! He is your favorite Italian plumber who has been bravely battling bad guys for decades to protect the mushroom kingdom and keep his beloved Princess Peach safe and away from Bowser, the King of Koopas. He is the great Mario, a fictional protagonist in the Mario video game franchise, owned by Nintendo and created by a Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto ("Mario" 2020). Ever since his creation, Mario has appeared in over 200 video games ("Mario" 2020), deeming him to be one of the most well known fictional mascots in the modern day gaming industry. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shigeru Miyamoto created Mario when developing the Donkey Kong game. Miyamoto originally wanted to use characters such as Popeye, Bluto, and Olive Oyl for Donkey Kong, however he was unable to obtain the necessary licenses. As a result, Miyamoto created an unnamed character when releasing the game. This unnamed character was later enabled to jump to improve on the game interactivity. Though the character was originally unnamed, after the game was released in the western world, he was named Jumpman in the English game instructions and as Mario in the sales brochure. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miyamoto wanted to name the character “Mr.Video”, however due to conflicts between the landlord of Nintendo’s warehouse in America and the then-president  Minoru Arakawa, it was decided in the end that the character should be named after the landlord, Mario Segale. The full character designs, such as the location, the mustache, and the job occupation were later filled in by Miyamoto in effort to make the character more easily identifiable.</p>
